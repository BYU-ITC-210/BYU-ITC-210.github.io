title: "Homework 6: UML Sequence Diagrams"
---
***

*30 points possible. 15 points for each UML diagram.*

***

## Introduction

For this homework you will produce two UML sequence diagrams that will inform your development of Lab 5 and will be included in the Lab 5 documentation.

## Objectives

* Understand what a UML sequence diagram means.
* Learn how to produce a UML sequence diagram.
* Use a UML sequence diagram to plan development work.

## Examples

Here are some good examples and resources from the web:

* [101Computing: Shopping Example](https://www.101computing.net/uml/Sequence.html)
* [Sequence Diagram for ATM](https://www.startertutorials.com/uml/uml-diagrams-atm-application.html/sequence-diagram-atm)
* [Lucidchart: How to Draw a Sequence Diagram in UML](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/how-to-draw-a-sequence-diagram-in-UML)

## Tools

You may use any tool you like for producing your UML. This includes hand-drawing the UML on paper and submitting a photo or scan. The objective is to understand UML Sequence Diagrams, NOT mastery of any particular drawing tool.

If you choose to use a digital tool, here are some good options:

* [LucidChart](https://lucidchart.com)
* [Diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net)
* [gleek_](https://www.gleek.io/)
* Microsoft PowerPoint
* Microsoft Visio

## Instructions

Produce two careful UML Sequence Diagrams reflecting the data that gets passed between different components that are part of lab 5.

Each diagram should include the following columns: 1) Client/Browser, 2) Endpoint (on the server) 3) Model (on the server) 4) Database.

This will be graded as a homework assignment, though it will also need to be included in your lab documentation.

You will make two separate UMLs for this assignment: one for displaying a user's existing tasks and one for creating a new task. These UMLs will be similar, but pay attention to the queriesÂ made to the database in each scenario.

## Submitting your assignment

Submit your work using View/Submit on the assignment in LearningSuite. If you have more than one file to submit, create a .zip file containing all parts of your submission.
