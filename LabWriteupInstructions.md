title: Lab Writeup Instructions
---
The purpose of Lab Write-ups is to make sure you understand what you are doing and to document what you've learned and the procedures you used. Your write-ups should look professional and the answers to the questions on the lab instructions should reflect what you might say to an employer during an interview. Ideally, you will be able to add each lab's repo (with writeup) to a project portfolio and submit it to a potential employer.

For each writeup, you will be using a simple text formatting markup language called Markdown. You can learn Markdown from these resources (and any others you find on the web):

* [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)
* [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet)
* [Markdown Crash Course (video 20min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUBNt18RFbo)

Please post your write-up as the README.md file for Lab B of the corresponding lab in GitHub, then submit a link to your repository in LearningSuite. Submitting your write up as the README.md file will make it appear on the primary page of your lab repo.

This [Lab Writeup Example](https://github.com/BYU-ITC-210/LabWriteupExample) should give you a good idea of what we expect. Since it's an actual GitHub repository you can access the MarkDown source code and see how the ReadMe is presented by GitHub.

All work must be your own, you may not copy and paste answers from any other sources. Please see **Academic Standards** in the Syllabus for details.

Lab Write-Ups should follow this outline:

## I. Introduction (Required):

Name, Date, and Lab Title

If this section is missing or incomplete, you will receive a 0 on the write-up until it is fixed. No late penalties will be applied.

## II. Executive Summary (3 pts):

Describe in one paragraph (3-5 sentences) what you have accomplished in this lab. Use a professional voice, appropriate terminology, and be succinct. Think of this as what you might say during a job interview when describing a project you've completed.

## III. Design Overview (5 pts):

This section gives a medium-high level view of the design. This should include the following:
* 2-3 Paragraphs describing your technical design with a focus on how it works.
* A UML Diagram appropriate to the lab. (Not required for Lab 1.)
* At least 3 screenshots illustrating what the web site looks like.
* Descriptions of each file that you created or modified as part of the lab. (index.html, etc).

Label each screenshot and UML diagram with a useful caption. For example: "UML of Data Storage through JSON format" or "The Drop-Down Menu for the Carousel on the Main Page."

See [UML Diagram Guidelines](UmlDiagrams) for more detail on our expectations regarding UML diagrams.

## IV. Questions (4 pts):

In this section, please paste the questions found at the bottom of the lab instructions and include your answers underneath. Each answer should be anywhere from one to three complete sentences. If a question has multiple parts, make sure to answer each part thoroughly. Act as if these questions were asked during a job interview and you are trying to get a job with the responses that you give.

## V. Lessons Learned (4 pts):

This is a record of at least 3 problems and/or learning experiences you ran into and their solutions. These should be formatted with a short heading (descriptive title of the problem) and a short paragraph describing how the problem was resolved. There should be three pieces of information in each: (1) what the problem or concern was, (2) why it happens, (3) the solution. *Please see the example writeup for suggested formatting.*

The focus of this section is the problem and its solution, not necessarily your personal experience/story with it (though the problems should come from things you ran into yourself).

## VI. Conclusions (4 pts):

List the skills you've acquired, practiced or demonstrated in the lab. This is slightly more descriptive than our list of technologies in the lab. Think of it as “now that I’ve done this lab, I can now do…” Please use bullet points for this. Here are some examples of the level of detail we would like you to have:

* Pass data using the JSON format
* Communicate asynchronously with a server to get data
* Dynamically change content on a web page

It is more professional to conjugate the verbs as if there is an invisible "I can" in front of each, than to write in the gerund (words ending in -ing). For example:

* (I can) Pass data through the JSON format. (This is better!)
* Passing data through the JSON format. (This feels awkward.)

### UML Diagrams

For Lab 1, a UML diagram is not required or relevant. Our class discussion of UML diagrams will happen before the Lab 2 writeup.

For Lab 1, a UML diagram is not relevant. Instead, you must include screenshots and/or other images relevant to your writeup.

Make sure that your screenshots and UML diagrams display correctly on GitHub before submitting them. Also, ensure that the screenshots are readable (TAs don’t have supervision if you can’t read it well, then neither can we).

For the UML diagrams, it is acceptable to submit photos taken with a phone, only if the UML has been hand-drawn. All UMLs made on a computer must be screenshots, not photos.
