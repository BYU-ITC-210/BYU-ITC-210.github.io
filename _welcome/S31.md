* Lab 5b due Tuesday
* Homework 7 due Friday.
    * Last homework for the semester! Though there is still the Lab 6 documentation assignment - bigger than a regular lab writeup.
* Open Subjects on Nov 23 and Dec 1.
    * We have a couple of extra periods this term. Please send subjects you would like to discuss either directly to me or via Slack. Subjects should be IT related but will not appear on any quiz or exam (unless they are already there). We already have a date allocated to the final exam review.
    * December 6 is also an extra subject. In that class I'll discuss Github Pages and Jekyll which is a quick and easy way to develop websites that are hosted for free.
