* All 210A Assignments have been scored. Please check your grades including the expected final grade and contact me if you have any concerns.
* Lab 5b Kickoff will be in the lab period today.
* Today is an inserted, "catch-up" session. I have shifted S30-S34 down one class-day. Due dates for all assignments remain unchanged.
* No Quizzes or homework through the end of March! (But there still are labs.)
