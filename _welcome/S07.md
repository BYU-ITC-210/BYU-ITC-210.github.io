* Our unit on JavaScript is concluded but you will be using a lot of JavaScript in Lab 2 and for the rest of the semester. If you need help understanding, consider doing the walkthroughs. They cover the critical parts of the language you need for the labs.
* Lab 2A is due Wednesday
    * JavaScript can be hard at first. Give yourself plenty of time.
* Homework 3 is due Friday. Will look into the HTTP protocol and the format of GET and POST requests.
* This week will be networking, debugging, and UML diagrams
