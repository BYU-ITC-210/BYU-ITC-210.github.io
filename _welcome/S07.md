* Our unit on JavaScript is concluded but you will be using a lot of JavaScript in Lab 2 and for the rest of the semester. If you need help understanding, consider doing the walkthroughs. They cover the critical parts of the language you need for the labs.
* Lab 1 Writeup due Today!
    * See Lab Writeup questions in the instructions for BOTH Lab 1a and Lab 1b.
    * Writeup will be in MarkDown format and posted as your README.md on Lab 1b.
    * Include your diagrams and/or screenshots.
    * Submit the _link_ to your Lab 1b repo in LearningSuite.
* Accept Lab 2A today (if you haven't done so yet) so your first commit is in there for full credit.
* All remaining labs for IT&C 210A have been posted. You can accept them early and start looking ahead if you choose.
