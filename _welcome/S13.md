* Lab 2 Writeup due Today!
    * Make sure you answer the questions in both Lab 2a and Lab 2b.
    * Collaborate with each other, especially on the UML diagrams.
    * But don't copy each others' UML. Just look at examples and do your own work!
* Lab 3 Kickoff Today!
    * Get started on your labs early. Too many of you are putting lab work off to Monday and that's too late!
* Homework due on Friday. UML diagram for Lab 3.
