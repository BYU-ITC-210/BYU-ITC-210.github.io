* Lab 2 Writeup due Today!
    * Make sure you answer the questions in both Lab 2a and Lab 2b.
    * Collaborate with each other, especially on the UML diagrams.
    * But don't copy each others' UML. Just look at examples and do your own work!
* Accept Lab 3A today (if you haven't done so yet) so your first commit is in there for full credit.
* Homework due next Friday. UML diagram for Lab 3.
