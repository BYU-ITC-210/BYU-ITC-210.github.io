* You should be finished with Lab 4A and starting work on 4B
    * If not, be sure to accept the lab by the end of the day for those first five points.
* (Consistent Repetition) Due to the term schedule, you have an extra half-week for Lab 4A. But Lab 4B is the hard one that may require extra time. We strongly encourage you to finish 4A early (and get extra credit) then give extra time to Lab 4B.
