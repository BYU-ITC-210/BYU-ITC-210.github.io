* Lab 4a due in one week
    * Lab kickoff video is on LearningSuite
* CRUD and REST Walkthrough from Monday has been fixed. Highly Recommended!
* (Consistent Repetition) Due to the term schedule, you have an extra half-week for Lab 4A. But Lab 4B is the hard one that may require extra time. We strongly encourage you to finish 4A early (and get extra credit) then give extra time to Lab 4B.
