* Lab 1a due on Wednesday. People seem to be making great progress. Be sure you're ready to run your lab on an AWS server.
* Quiz 1 in-class on Friday.
* Homework 2 also due on Friday.
* Eleven of you have not yet done the syllabus and policy quiz. We won't score other assignments until that is done!
