* Homework 1 is due today. Most of you have already done it. If you aren't satisfied with your score, you can re-submit. The first version was messed up but if you did that version we'll hand score and carry it over for you.
* For those who haven't done Homework 1, remember that it's easier to do steps 1 and 2 of Lab 1 before doing Homework 1 because those steps get the tools installed.
* You should have received an invitation to AWS Academy Learner Lab in your email. If you have not, check with me. Step 7 of Lab 1 will indicate what to do with the invitation.
* Lab 1A is due on Wednesday. People seem to be making great progress.
* Seven of you have not yet done the Syllabus and Policy quiz. Remember that it is required before we will grade other assignments.
