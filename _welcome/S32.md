* Lab 5 Writeup Due Today
* Lab 6a Kickoff Today in Lab Period (Only two more labs!)
* Homework 7 due Friday.
    * Last homework for the semester! Though there is still the Lab 6 documentation assignment - bigger than a regular lab writeup.
* Friday classes on Tuesday, Nov 23.
* Open Subjects on Nov 23 and Dec 1.
    * We have a couple of extra periods this term. Please send subjects you would like to discuss either directly to me or via Slack. Subjects should be IT related but will not appear on any quiz or exam (unless they are already there). I have posted some possibilities on Slack. Add your ideas or vote for the ones you like.
