title: Operations, Virtualization, and Cron
session: S32
---

* Lab 5b due date deferred due to problems with AWS Academy yesterday.
    * AWS acknowledged the issue and claims to have fixed it. The TAs and I will need to verify the fix before we set a new due date. Most likely it will be tomorrow (Thursday). Please watch Slack.
* Lab 5 writeup is *still* due today!
    * Because of the AWS problems affecting Lab 5b, you only need to include lab 5a in your writeup.
    * You can put the writeup in your README for Lab 5a, in the README for Lab 5b (replacing the existing README) or wherever else you want. Just make sure the link you submit on LearningSuite is to wherever you put it.
* Homework 7 due Friday.
    * Last homework for the semester!
* Quiz 7 on Monday
    * Covers sessions S28 to S32: Regular Expressions, Systems Design, Internationalization, Node.js, Web Analytics, and Virtualization (today's lecture).
* Videos for S30 have been posted. Videos for S31-S32 will be posted today.
