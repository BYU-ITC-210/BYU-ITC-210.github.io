* Lab 2A due on Wednesday
* Quiz 2 on Friday at the beginning of class
* Homework 3 due on Friday - it's an exercise on what we're talking about today.
* Check the "General" channel on Slack for departmental activities such as the CCDC team tryouts, ITCSA activities, STEM career fair and more.
* **Reminder:** Before contacting the TAs to pass off your lab, check the Report/Passoff section in the instructions and make sure everything on that list is covered.
* We didn't finish Friday's lecture so we'll finish that up today. To avoid getting behind we'll probably take about 15 minutes of lab time to catch up on lectures.
