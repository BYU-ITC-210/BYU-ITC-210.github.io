* Lab 5b alternative option due to AWS Academy outage
    * I and other professors are furious about this. Outages that involve data loss are most serious type.
    * If you had a problem with 5b check the alternative. It should take you about 5 minutes.
* Lab 5 writeup need only address Lab 5a questions.
    * If you haven't done it yet, it's late but still please turn it in. And contact me if the AWS outage affected your work on the writeup.
* Homework 7 due **Today**.
    * Last homework for the semester! Though there is still the Lab 6 documentation assignment - bigger than a regular lab writeup.
* Quiz 7 on **Monday**
    * Covers sessions S28 to S32: Regular Expressions, Systems Design, Internationalization, Node.js, Web Analytics, and Virtualization.
* "Extra Subject" lecture next Friday
    * Would you like a practical subject (e.g. **GitHub Pages**)?
    * Or a theoretical subject (e.g. **Internet 3.0**)?
    * Regardless, it won't be on the exam.
