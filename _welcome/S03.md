* The slide deck for each lesson concludes with a set of review questions. Those are a good way to prepare for the next quiz.
* Lab 1B Kickoff in lab period today.
* Homework 2, CSS, due on Friday. We recommend that you do it before Lab 1B which is also CSS.
* In LearningSuite, today's lesson includes a walkthrough that shows four ways to create the common 5-box layout in HTML and CSS. We will not have time to do that in class but it describes some valuable HTML and CSS practices. I recommend that you do the walkthrough on your own time.
* I will post the source code we create in today's demo on LearningSuite after class.
