* Quiz 1 today, at the beginning of class
* Homework 2 due on Today: CSS
    * Best to do this one before getting deep into Lab 1b as the CSS experience in the homework will help with the lab.
* Catching up
    * We're behind on CSS so we will use part of today's lab period to get caught up on the lectures.
