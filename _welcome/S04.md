* Quiz 1 today, at the beginning of class
* Homework 2 due Today: CSS
    * Best to do this one before getting deep into Lab 1b as the CSS experience in the homework will help with the lab.
* Accept Lab 1B today (if you haven't done so yet) so your first commit is in there - for full credit.
* Today's demo is a walkthrough which you can follow at [https://byu-itc-210.github.io/walkthrough/IntroToJavaScript](https://byu-itc-210.github.io/walkthrough/IntroToJavaScript). The link is also in LearningSuite.
* Catching up
    * We didn't finish positioning in CSS so we will use part of today's lab period to do that.
