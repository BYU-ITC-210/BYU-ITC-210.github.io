* Today's quiz is a "formative assessment." You may not know the answers to the questions but you will get credit for answering anything.
* If you are new:
    * Check out the First Steps in LearningSuite - Content
    * Complete the Syllabus and Policy Quiz!
* Lab 4A is due a week from Tuesday
    * Due to the term schedule, you have an extra half-week for Lab 4A. But Lab 4B is a hard one that may require extra time. We strongly encourage you to finish 4A early (and get extra credit) and give extra time to Lab 4B.
* Homework 5 is due a week from today. Only quizzes between now an then.
