* Ah Monday! No assignments due!
* Lab 1B (CSS) due on Wednesday.
* Lab 1 Writeup due on Friday. Remember to review the lab writeup instructions.
* Because we're behind on the lectures, we may extend into the lab period today. If you can't stay for that part, no worries. It's all in the JavaScript walkthroughs.
