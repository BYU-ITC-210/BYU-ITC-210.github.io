* We are scoring your 210A exams and assignments. Grades will come soon.
* Lab 4A is underway, due a week from Wednesday. Accept and get started soon as Lab 4B will take longer.
* If you are at all unsure about Fetch and asynchronous programming I strongly recommend the Fetch walkthrough from Friday and today's REST walkthrough. Links are in LearningSuite.
* (Consistent Repetition) Due to the term schedule, you have an extra half-week for Lab 4A. But Lab 4B is the hard one that may require extra time. We strongly encourage you to finish 4A early (and get extra credit) then give extra time to Lab 4B.
