title: MVC, C#, and Razor
session: S21
---

* Walkthroughs for C#, MVC, and Razor are up on LearningSuite. They are the same as done in class but you may find it valuable to do them yourself.
* For lab 4 we're using Azure and MongoDB. AWS will return for lab 5.
* We're still scoring the 210A final exam and extra credit - that will be done very soon.
* *If you're new, just joining us for 210B, please check in with me before or after class today.*
