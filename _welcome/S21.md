* We are scoring your 210A exams and assignments. Grades will come soon.
* Lab 4A is underway, due on Wednesday. Make sure you accept the lab by end-of-day today to get the first five points.
* If you are at all unsure about Fetch and asynchronous programming I strongly recommend the Fetch walkthrough from Wednesday and today's REST walkthrough. Links are in LearningSuite.
