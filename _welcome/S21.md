* Extra credit for IT&C 210A has been scored
* We're still scoring the IT&C 210A final exam. Results soon!
* If you're having any trouble getting started with Lab 4 (Azure accounts, installing Visual Studio) check in with a TA!
* Walkthroughs for C#, MVC, and Razor are up on LearningSuite. They are the same done in class but you may find it valuable to do them yourself.
* Videos for S20 and S21 coming tomorrow. (First and second sessions of IT&C 210B).
