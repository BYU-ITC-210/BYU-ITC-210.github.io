* Lab 2B due today
* Lab 3A PHP Part 1 Kickoff Today
* Lab 2 Writeup due on Friday
    * Make sure you answer the questions in both Lab 2a and Lab 2b.
    * You can collaborate with each other, including on the UML diagrams.
    * But don't copy each others' text or UML. Just look at examples and do your own work!
* I will be at a conference next Wednesday. One of the TAs will teach the class that day. (Be kind to them!ðŸ™‚)
