title: Lab 5b Alternative - Winter 2022
---
AWS Academy had a system failure on March 28-29 2022. This caused many IT&C 210 students to waste a lot of time trying to finish Lab 5b.

At this point, we're already moving on to Lab 6a. And with only two weeks of class left we can't afford to waste your time. Therefore we are offering an alternative way to get credit for Lab 5b.

Since we are learning IT and Cybersecurity, the alternative involves learning from this unplanned but real IT experience.

**Outline:**

* Outage Summary (so you can learn from the incident)
* Full Credit for Conventional Completion
* Alternative Assignment 

## Outage Summary

All that AWS has sent so far is, "We had a Vocareum outage revolving around learner labs." They did not indicate the nature of the outage or what effect it would have. As of 8:00pm (Mountain) on Tuesday, March 29 they claimed that the issue had been fixed but we have not yet verified that in our own testing.

In our experience we found that virtual machines disappeared, the content of files was deleted, and storage showed as full when it wasn't. AWS has promised to work with Vocareum to produce a [Root Cause Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause_analysis) and that they will share it with the AWS Academy community. Root Cause Analysis is proper practice following an outage like this. It determines exactly what went wrong, what caused the problem, how to prevent a repeat, and measures the impact was of the problem.

For our class, the incident occurred at the worst possible time because Lab 5b exclusively involves configuring a server. All of our other labs begin with development on your local machine with progress stored in your GitHub repo. Thus you have a natural backup and an alternative place to show your work. Lab 5b doesn't have those benefits. Compounding that was that the outage hit on the due date for the lab.

Using the [Atlassian Categorization](https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/severity-levels) this is Level 1 severity because there was permanent data loss. AWS Academy should be taking this very seriously.

## Full Credit for Conventional Completion

If you complete and pass off Lab 5b any time before the end of classes (on or before April 13) you will get full credit.

## Alternative Assignment for Full Credit

Many of you had made serious progress or were nearly finished with the lab when AWS lost your work. Rather than redo all of that, just tell your story.

Specifically:

* Indicate how much time you spent on Lab 5b.
* Describe what you had done so far and how the outage affected you.
* What did you learn from the experience?

This doesn't have to be very long 6-10 sentences at most. And, in this case, I'm not grading on spelling or grammar.

Thank you!
