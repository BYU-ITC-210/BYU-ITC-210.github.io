title: "Homework 4: UML Activity Diagram"
---

*30 points possible. 15 points for each UML diagram.*

## Introduction

For this homework you will produce a UML activity diagram _with swimlanes_ that will inform your development of Lab 3 and will be included in the Lab 3 writeup.

## Objectives

* Understand what a UML activity diagram means.
* Use swimlanes to indicate the tasks done by different parts of the program.
* Learn how to produce a UML activity diagram.
* Use a UML activity diagram to plan development work.

## Examples

A Web Image search for "UML Activity Diagram" will yield some good examples. Look for one that includes swim lanes.

Here are some selected examples:

* [Activity Diagram with Swimlane Sample](http://etutorials.org/Programming/UML/Chapter+9.+Activity+Diagrams/Swimlanes/)
* [Lucidchart Activity Diagram Example](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/templates/uml-activity/lucidchart-activity-diagram-with-swimlanes-example)
* [StarterTutorials: Activity Diagrams](https://www.startertutorials.com/uml/activity-diagrams.html)

## Tools

You may use any tool you like for producing your UML. This includes hand-drawing the UML on paper and submitting a photo or scan. The objective is to understand UML Sequence Diagrams, NOT mastery of any particular drawing tool.

If you choose to use a digital tool, here are some good options:

* [LucidChart](https://lucidchart.com)
* [Diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net)
* [gleek_](https://www.gleek.io/)
* Microsoft PowerPoint
* Microsoft Visio

## Instructions

Create a UML activity diagram for Lab 3a using correct notation as discussed in class S6 (see slides). Make sure it uses the following swimlanes: "User", "Browser", "Server/PHP", "Database". It should carefully walk through the login and registration portion of the lab.

You should have one UML for registration and another one for login. Each should include a start and end circle, conditional diamonds (e.g., to show error handling or other logic) with labeled edges, and the key activities that occur at the various stages of the project (e.g., creating session variables, sending data, running queries...).

You may use any drawing tool to create the UML including hand-drawing and taking a scan or photo. Lucidchart.com, Diagrams.net, yEd, Visio, and PowerPoint are all good choices.

Use the button below to upload your UML. Acceptable formats are: .PDF, .JPG (JPEG) or .PNG
